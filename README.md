This repository contains my work from Security Of Embedded Systems assignments. You can find the lab manuals as well as my reports here.

This is only meant to showcase my work to the public. If you are currently taking this class at Texas A&M University or plan to take it, please wait until the end of your term to download or look at these solutions.
